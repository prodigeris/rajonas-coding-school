# Fizz Buzz

## Introduction

After all the hard work that you've done today, you've started dreaming about your childhood.

How easy everything was. How many things you were learning.

You learned how to count, how to divide the numbers.

You vaguely remember the game that helped you learn division.

How was it called again? F.. fizz... Fizz Buzz!

## Background

**No background given. Replicate the same boilerplate from the previous exercises.**

## Exercise

The user is prompted to give a number.

Fizz Buzz game has only three rules:

- If a number is dividable by `3` then it is `Fizz`
- If a number is dividable by `5` then it is `Buzz`
- If a number is dividable by `3` AND `5`, then guess what? It's `Fizz Buzz`!

Your application needs to accept the number from the user and return the number or its alias.
